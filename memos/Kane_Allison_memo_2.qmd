## Prediction goal

The goal is to classify which diabetic patients would be readmitted to the hospital after their initial discharge. 

:::

## Data source

This dataset includes data of diabetes patients admitted to the hospital for a maximum of 2 weeks at 130 different clinical care hospitals or healthcare settings from 1999 to 2008.^[Clore, John, Cios, Krzysztof, DeShazo, Jon, and Strack, Beata. (2014). Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008. UCI Machine Learning Repository.[ https://doi.org/10.24432/C5230J.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)]

## Data Plan

To investigate this classification problem and accurately predict which patients return to the hospital, I will examine the data as follows. I will first process and clean the data, identifying variables that are redundant or do not make sense and ensuring they are not included in the models. I will account for missingness issues as well. Then, I will process and split the data into training and testing sets. I will also create a resamples dataset using vfold for model cross-validation. Then, I will use a logistical regression style recipe and a tree-based recipe to form models. The models will include these six: logistical regression (null/baseline), lasso (applied to logistical approach), ridge (applied to logistical approach), knn nearest neighbor, random forest and gradient boosted tree. I will then assess their performance ideally using accuracy and roc_auc_curve metrics.
